                <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.

                    Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness
                    and
                    recover without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical
                    problems
                    like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to
                    develop serious illness.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the
                    disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your
                    hands
                    or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an
                    infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette
                    (for
                    example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).

                    At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many
                    ongoing
                    clinical trials evaluating potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated information as
                    soon as clinical findings become available.</p>

                <h2>Preventions</h2>
                <p>To prevent the spread of COVID-19: <br>
                    1) Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.<br>
                    2) Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.<br>
                    3) Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.<br>

                    </script>
                    4) Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.<br>
                    5) Stay home if you feel unwell.<br>
                    6) If you have a fever, a cough, and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention. Call in
                    advance.<br>
                    7) Follow the directions of your local health authority.<br></p>

                        60% to 80% of small particles under lab conditions. When worn properly, they can help prevent
                        the spread of the coronavirus by catching droplets when you cough or sneeze. <br><br>
                        * Medical masks are often made out of layers of breathable, paperlike synthetic fabric that is
